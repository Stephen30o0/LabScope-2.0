"Scientists estimate that Hydrogen makes up over 90 percent of all the atoms in the universe. While, Hydrogen becomes a liquid at very low temperature and high pressure. It is thought that metallic hydrogen exists at the cores of gas giant planets like Jupiter. Also around 10 percent of the mass of the human body is hydrogen."
"The speed of sound in helium is around three times the speed of sound in the air. This causes people's voices to get high pitched and squeaky when they breathe helium (note: never breathe helium as you can suffocate if you breathe too much). In general, helium will not combine with itself to create molecules, but is found as a single atom."
"Although Lithium is a metal, it is soft enough to cut with a knife. It is so light it can float on water. Lithium fires are difficult to put out, and you can't use water as water will react with the lithium and could make the fire worse. Therefore a powder fire extinguisher is needed. When burning, lithium gives off a bright red flame."
"A beryllium atom has four electrons and four protons. It was originally discovered in a compound with oxygen called beryllium oxide. Alloys with beryllium can produce a hard, tough, and lightweight metal that is used for spacecraft, missiles, satellites, and high-speed airplanes."
